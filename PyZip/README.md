# PyZip
The absolute self extractor

#### Reasons for use:

##### Benefits:
* Allows anyone with Python to extract your files
* Doesn't require extra installations (on specific systems)
##### Downsides:
* Stores in Base64
* Larger
* Doesn't support encryption

#### How to use:
1. Create your zip; it is recommended to use 1 subdirectory
2. Rename the zip to `archive.zip`, then run `python3 main.py`. Please note that it will also automatically unzip the zip file. Is it a good idea? **NO!** Do I do it anyway? **YES!**
3. Send `archive.zip` to your friend or enemy. Also, I do not care what is put in the zip; I cannot track it, I don't encourage using pirated media, but who will stop you?
4. Learn that your friend doesn't understand how to use Python.
