# Good times, after a bit, Ender went on break, tinkering with the cool bookmarklets repo
# Because of that, I went on break, exploring the digital plain, after a bit, I noticed the GitHub account was more active,
# but he has been so busy he has forgot about me, it's fine, I just need to make myself known to him
